# Data Mining in Social Media
This document contains my solution for the first course assignment on GitHub. I present responses to two recent newspaper articles about mobile messaging application WhatsApp's recently announced policy that would allow data to be shared to parent company Facebook. The first article presents a quite pesssimistic view while the second argues that the situation is not as bad as some believe.

## Article 01: WhatsApp's Policy Indicates A Shift Towards Less Data Privacy
The Guardian's recent news article "[WhatsApp users are really Facebook customers now – it's getting harder to forget that](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/11/whatsapp-facebook-app-privacy-policy)" argues that the new policy is a call for concern, especially for privacy-concerned users. One of WhatsApp's biggest boons in the past has been that it provided an advertisement-free and secure experience that was far less invasive than Facebook's pervasive use of data mining and targeted content. However, the new policy now indicates that Facebook is looking to now integrate WhatsApp more fully, which will be a source of worry to those against Facebook's practices.

## Article 02: WhatsApp Users Will Largely Enjoy The Same Experience That They Already Love
In contrast to the first article, Campaign US's writing piece "[WhatsApp’s new data policy is not as scary as it sounds for brands or users](https://www.campaignlive.com/article/whatsapps-new-data-policy-not-scary-sounds-brands-users/1705677)" takes less of a negative approach and argues that the policy does not really change things for the vast majority of users. Rather, the greater sharing of data is likely to actually improve consumer experience.
