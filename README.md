# Data Mining in Social Media
This document contains my solution for the first course assignment on GitHub. I present responses to two recent newspaper articles about mobile messaging application WhatsApp's recently announced policy that will allow data to be shared to parent company Facebook. The first article presents a quite pessimistic view of the situation while the second argues that the situation is not as bad as some believe.

## Article 01: WhatsApp's Policy Indicates A Shift Towards Less Data Privacy
The Guardian's recent news article "[WhatsApp users are really Facebook customers now – it's getting harder to forget that](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/11/whatsapp-facebook-app-privacy-policy)" argues that the new policy is a call for concern, especially for privacy-concerned users. One of WhatsApp's biggest boons in the past has been that it provided an advertisement-free and secure experience that was far less invasive than Facebook. However, the new policy now indicates that Facebook is looking to now integrate WhatsApp more fully, which will be a source of worry for those against Facebook's practices.

I personally agree with this article's wary view. The greater integretion of Facebook with WhatsApp indicates that the Facebook company is strengthening its monopoly on messaging applications (it also owns Instagram and Facebook Messenger). And given how the company has a habit of introducing similar features across different platforms (e.g., stories were introduced on both Instagram and WhatsApp), I am worried that the market will be saturated with identical (or at least very similar) applications that will allow consumers less freedom in terms of the feature sets they desire. This is also likely to discourage the individual applications' divisions from developing unique new features since the applications are going to be uniformized anyways, thereby reducing innovation. On the flip side, as the article suggests, there are alternative applications (e.g., Signal) that consumers are now being encouraged to explore and this might at least help encourage smaller third-party applications to grow a bit.

There is also the problem of less data privacy and security. It is already known that Facebook makes extensive use of targeted advertisements. Though the current policy plan will not share individual chats but will rather only log aggregate data (much in line with the booming trend of big data analysis)), it does indicate that Facebook is looking to data-mine WhatsApp accounts and utilize user behavior from there to serve their own goals. Herein, Facebook's agenda can potentially range from revenue generation to political manipulation. For instance, since Facebook will now possess greater data about its users and because Facebook accounts will be linked to WhatsApp accounts, they might be able to increase their targested advertisements, thereby manipulating markets as well. This idea is further supported by how Facebook is now looking to roll out a "WhatsApp Pay" feature which may give them access to people's debit card and credit card information. Although consumers may be looking to provide such confidential details to WhatsApp, they _*might*_ not be able to do without also sharing the information to Facebook. Given how the Facebook has previously had its databases breached, WhatsApp users also risk their bank accounts being accessed by malicious third-parties.
## Article 02: WhatsApp Users Will Largely Enjoy The Same Old Experience
In contrast to the first article, Campaign US's writing piece "[WhatsApp’s new data policy is not as scary as it sounds for brands or users](https://www.campaignlive.com/article/whatsapps-new-data-policy-not-scary-sounds-brands-users/1705677)" takes less of a negative approach and argues that the policy does not really change things for the vast majority of users. Rather, the greater sharing of data is likely to actually improve consumer experience.

While I do think that many WhatsApp users do not need to be concerned
